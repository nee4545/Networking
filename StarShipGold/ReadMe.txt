Deep Learning

As I used my previous assignment's clone (Starship Playable) as the base and started implementing all the features,
I found implmenting certain parts very challenging because of the way I implemented my previous assignment.
I realized that modifying an existing code is much harder than working on something from scratch.
Looking at my previous code i realized that i hard code a lot without my knowledge as I focus on making the
assignment just complete with all the features and no more, so scaling it or modifying it for future upgrades on the 
same code is really hard.
