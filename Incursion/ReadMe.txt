Deep Learning
 
I have some idea about planning for future changes into my code i.e while writing the code I am able to imagine if the code I write now
is easily modifyalbe for futher enhancements.
I feel I need to work more on time management and improve the readability of code as I strongly feel an outside person will not easily understand my code.
I noticed that in many areas I unknowingly hard code stuff which makes my life harder and simple problems become harder to change and fix.
